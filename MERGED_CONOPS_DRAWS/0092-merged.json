      "MISSION": "with Range Control, and coordination with Dakota TRP.\nPhase 2: Movement. This Phase begins with Comanche TRP SP to Range 211 and ends with TRP CP established. Key to this phase is using allotted route, establishment of the TAA, and Range Control coordination.\nPhase 3:",
      "PURPOSE": "of this event is to familiarize Soldiers assigned to the DMR. Decisive to this event is the establishment of a safe firing box. This is decisive because it will ensure Soldiers are able to safely and proficiently engage targets ranging out to 800 meters. We assume risk through live ammunition. We will mitigate this risk through planning, range safeties, and proper wear of PPE.\nTraining Objectives Establish DMR Weapon System\nEngage targets at distances ranging out to 800 meters\nEmploy a spotter to assist in target engagement",
      "END STATE": "DMR shooters effectively operate weapon system.",
      "EXECUTION": ". This phase begins with TRP CP established and ends with the Comanche TRP RTB. Key to this phase is the validation of SOPs, certification of firers, communication between elements, and AARs.\nPhase 4: Reconsolidation. This phase begins with the SP of C TRP and ends when all MWE is accounted for in TRP AO. Key to this phase is CL V dunnage, accountability of MWE, and initiating recovery. ​",
