OIC and RSO will orient soldiers to the range and conduct a safety brief. Soldiers will coach/safety each other on the firing line with NCO's safetying in a 1:1 ratio. OIC and RSO will continuously monitor all aspects of the Qualification. Newly Identified risks will be recorded and mitigated accordingly and risk acceptance will be improved at the appropriate level. Every Soldier will be considered a safety, if they see an unsafe act they will call a cease fire and notify everyone to stop training. The range has an RSO and constant access to the range tower radio and telephone to contact the Range Control Firing Desk and 7ATC as appropriate. In the event of a real word MEDEVAC event on site, Safeties and Training Support Personnel are responsible for ceasing fire on the range and communication directly with the OIC/RSO of the range to coordinate MEDEVAC. SUAS subject matter expert will be present during sUAS Operations. \r\rI assess the initial risk of this event to be of critical severity with seldom probability, but with mitigation efforts I assess the residual risk of this event to be critical severity of unlikely probability.",
