      "MISSION": "1/2CR Master SUAS Trainers conduct a quadcopter (Skydio X2D) familiarization training from 04-05 April 2024 at the Vilseck Army Air Field (VAAF) IOT certify operators from other Squadron’s ISO Saber Strike 24.\nCommander’s",
      "INTENT": "Expanded",
      "PURPOSE": "Certifying operators from other Squadrons within the Regiment and additional adjacent units expands the scope of SUAS capabilities, facilitating additional realism in maneuver training and combat readiness.",
      "KEY TASKS": "Conduct academic instruction\nConduct hands-on familiarization with the flight systems\nConduct training flights\n4) Conduct dropping flights",
      "END STATE": "2/2CR, 3/2CR, and the 173rd IBCT(A) all have operators who are certified to fly the Skydio X2D quadcopter.\nTraining Objectives\n1. Teach basics of sUAS to students.​\n2. Improve knowledge and understanding of the Skydio system.​\n3. Instruct students on proper safety practices with the Skydio.​\n4. Demonstrate how to properly fly Skydio system.​\n5. Students practice flying the Skydio on VAAF.​\nResourcing\nOIC: LT Dunn\tRSO: SGT Koehling\nChow: M / M\nPOC: LT Nathanael Lowe Nathanael.r.lowe.mil@army.mil\nCOA: 4-5 0630-1600 Apr 2024\nVAAF"
