      "PURPOSE": "of this event is to certify all Squads during LFX conditions and set conditions for PLT-level",
      "TASKS": ". Decisive to this event is the completion of dry and blank fire. This is decisive because it will ensure Squads are prepared to advance to the live fire iteration. We assume tactical risk by using live ammunition. We will mitigate this risk through planning, rehearsals, range safeties, and proper wear of PPE.\nTraining Objectives Conduct a Squad Assault (07-SQD-D9515)\nConduct SBF (07-SQD-3000)\nReact to Direct Fire Contact While Dismounted (07-SQD-D9501)",
      "END STATE": "Squads effectively plan and rehearse. Squads employ direct fire control principles and are prepared to execute collective training at higher echelons.",
      "EXECUTION": ". This phase begins with TRP CP established and ends with the Comanche TRP RTB. Key to this phase is the validation of SOPs and SQD RXLs, certification of SQD LFXs, communication between elements, and AARs.\nPhase 4: Reconsolidation. This phase begins with the SP of C TRP and ends when all MWE is accounted for in TRP AO. Key to this phase is CL V dunnage, accountability of MWE, and initiating recovery. ​",
