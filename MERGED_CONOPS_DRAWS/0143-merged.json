The range has an RSO and constant access to the \nrange tower radio and telephone to contact the Range Control Firing Desk and 7ATC as appropriate. In the event of a real word MEDEVAC \nevent on site, Safeties and Training Support Personnel are responsible for ceasing fire on the range and communication directly with the OIC/\nRSO of the range to coordinate MEDEVAC. \nI assess the initial risk of this event to be of critical severity with seldom probability, but with mitigation efforts I assess the residual risk of \nthis event to be critical severity of unlikely probability.",
