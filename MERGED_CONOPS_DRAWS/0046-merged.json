      "COORDINATING INSTRUCTIONS": "–\nCPL Oliveri conducts remedial training for soldiers who have issues zeroing\n5.",
      "CMD AND SIGNAL": "Signal\nPrimary: Safety Paddles\nAlternate: Cell Phone\nContingency: N/A\nEmergency: Runner\nOIC: 1LT Cochran\nRSO: SSG Bagot\nAmmo NCOIC: SGT Jackson\nMedic: SGT Pater",
      "PURPOSE": "– Apache TRP ensures soldiers are fundamentally sound on all levels of marksmanship and are fully capable to zero and qualify on their weapon systems.",
      "KEY TASKS": "are movement from the range back to the motor pool, AAR, and recovery of weapons and equipment.\nConcept of the Operation\nPH1,&2\nPH3&4\nConcept of the Operation Concept of the Operation: The Stress Shoot will occur in three phases: I) Setup, II) Stressor, III) Shooting. Phase I: Setup. Firers line up 5 meters behind their rifles (which are laying in the firing position pointed down range) with three 5-round magazines in their full dragoon standard (minus pro mask) and await the order of the tower to begin. Tower places the targets on “bob.” Phase II: Stressor. Tower announces to firers to begin. Safeties start their timer. Each lane completes 10 burpees over a sandbag and then farmer carries two full water cans to each end of the firing line and then returns to their station.\nPhase III: Shooting. Firers pick up their rifle and load their first 5-round magazine to engage their targets from either the standing-supported or kneeling-supported position. Each of the targets only needs to go down once. Safeties will call out hits. Once empty, transition to the second 5-round magazine and assume the prone-unsupported position. If there are targets remaining, load the third 5-round magazine and assume the prone-supported position. Time stops when either out of ammo or all seven targets have been successfully engaged.\nStress Shoot\nLane 1\nLane 2\nLane 3\nLane 4\nLane 5\nLane 6\nFarmers Carry (Lane 4 Route)\nLane Setup (Lane 4 Example)\nLegend- = Sandbang Burpee Area = Firing Position = Outgoing Direction = Incoming Direction\nCLASS V: M4 BREAKDOWN PER FIRER DAY\nTotal: 40 rounds\nPAX: 3 from C TRP (120 rounds)\nCLASS V: M249 BREAKDOWN PER FIRER DAY\nPAX: 24\nAAR Comments\nSustains:\nGood level of physical activity for multiple solid attempts\nGood types of activity to use to stress\nImproves:\n-Decide exactly how much of each type of range to do beforehand to avoid switching back and forth\n-Add more difficult positions (standing unsupported, shooting through the small holes in the support, etc.)\n-Add different types of stress competitions\n-Announce incentives upfront\n-Standardize the waiting que to avoid sandbaggers",
      "EXECUTION": "This phase begins with the occupation of Range 123 on and ends once the last Soldier has been qualified on 05JUN24.",
      "SUSTAINMENT": "Class I – M/M/M; Each PLT will provide MREs and water for their respective soldiers\nClass III – Refuel vehicles if needed\nClass V – TBA\nClass VIII – CLS bag / PLT\nRange 102\nConcept of the Operation Concept of the Operation: We will accomplish the"
