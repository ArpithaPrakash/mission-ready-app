      "PURPOSE": "Familiarize young Dragoons with the M320 Grenade Launcher. Teach the characteristics of the weapons system. Conduct and demonstrate clearing, loading, and firing of the weapon system. M320 Characteristics: 1. Caliber- 40x46mm\n2. Weight- 3.42 lbs\n3. Barrel Length- 8.46 in 4. Muzzle Velocity- 74mps(243 fps/HEDP)\n5. Trigger Pull- 11.25-15.75 lbs\n6. Max Range- 400 meters\n* Effective Range-Point Target: 150 meters\n*Effective Range- Area target: 350 meters\nProcedure:\nClearing: 1. Point the muzzle in a safe direction, with the trigger finger outside the trigger guard. 2. Put the selector lever in the S(safe) position. 3. Push the barrel release button up, allowing the barrel to swing out to the left side of the receiver. 4. Physically and visually inspect the chamber for obstructions, ammunition or empty cartridge case. Loading: 1. Ensure Safety lever is set on S9safe)\n2. Press barrel release lever up, allowing the barrel to swing out. 3. Insert cartridge ensuring it is fully seated in the chamber. 4. Return barrel to the closed position making sure that it is locked. Firing: Failure to fire:\nPlace safety lever to S(safe) Wait for 30 seconds, with weapon pointed down range\nPull trigger again\nIf round still fails, wait 30 seconds again:\nUnlock and open barrel\nRemove faulty cartridge, inspecting primer Reinsert round, attempt to fire again\nIf round still does not fire Dispose of cartridge IAW applicable procedures\nDemonstrate Proper use of Leaf Sight",
