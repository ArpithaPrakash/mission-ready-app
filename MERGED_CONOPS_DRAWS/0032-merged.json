Vehicles has ample amount of water before leaving motor pool for training. Soldiers given safety brief on weather. If temperature drops below freezing at night, soldiers will be cycled through Strykers; which will be used as our heating mechanism. \r\rMost Likely Risk : Slips, Trips, and Falls with Heavy Equipment\rMitigation: Ensuring proper PPE is worn during operations and slowing down any nonessential movement to ensure soldiers move heavy equipment in and out of vehicle safely. Par of the mitigation will be to briefed about weather conditions and empower soldiers to modify any surface deem unsafe before and during the training event.",
