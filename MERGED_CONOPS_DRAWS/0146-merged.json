Every Soldier will be considered a safety, \nif they see an unsafe act they will call a cease fire and notify everyone to stop training. The range has an RSO and constant access to the \nrange tower radio and telephone to contact the Range Control Firing Desk and 7ATC as appropriate. In the event of a real word MEDEVAC \nevent on site, Safeties and Training Support Personnel are responsible for ceasing fire on the range and communication directly with the OIC/\nRSO of the range to coordinate MEDEVAC. \nI assess the initial risk of this event to be of critical severity with seldom probability, but with mitigation efforts I assess the residual risk of \nthis event to be critical severity of unlikely probability.",
