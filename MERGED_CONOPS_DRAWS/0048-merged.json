      "PURPOSE": "Each Platoon will conduct an offensive operation on a n inferior near peer force in an urban environment and develop an area defense IOT test ability to maneuver while mounted and dismounted as well as test",
      "EXECUTION": ". This phase begins with TRP CP established in the training area and ends with the SP of 1PLT to PB. Key to this phase is the validation of SOPs through FoF training, communication between elements and the TOC, and recording of successful/unsuccessful procedures.\nPhase 4: Reconsolidation. This phase begins with the SP of A TRP to RB and ends when all weapons are turned into the arms room. Key to this phase is the proper sorting/turn-in of all dunnage, and accountability of all MWE. ​",
