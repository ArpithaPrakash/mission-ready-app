      "MISSION": "Operator, and one Master Trainer to over-watch flight operations. Aircrews will begin system assembly and pre-flight checks. Each aircrew will successfully launch, fly for 15 minutes, land and recover the Raven (approx. 30 minutes). Once complete, they will switch crew roles and conduct a second successful sortie.\nConcurrently, students not conducting live flight exercises will conduct simulation flights to gain experience and build progression.\nTraining will end once each student has conducted a successful sortie in each operator role (Day/Night).\nCONOP",
      "PURPOSE": "Provide Squadron with certified SUAS operators and support personnel requirements to send Soldiers to the Master Trainer Couse.",
      "KEY TASKS": "Resource equipment and land to conduct training All operators will be verified and updated on SUASMAN prior to range start date\nEach Soldier will have the minimum 15 minutes of live flight training required per AR 95-23.\nConduct flight evaluation and practical exercise with Raven as outlined in AR 95-23 and SQDN SOP.\nMT’s will update SUASMAN NLT COB of flights",
      "END STATE": "All Soldiers that attend the Live Flight Training will record at least 15 minutes of flight time. Soldiers will be certified as current and qualified SUAS operators in SUASMAN. Concept of the Operation:\nPhase I (Preparation): Begins upon receipt of order and ends with completion of the Safety brief on 20JUL. Critical",
      "TASKS": "100% MWE, Clear FARP WEST, MT’s update SUASMAN NLT COB 21JUL, Master Trainer’s conducts an AAR IOT improve future SUAS operations.\nService & Support:\n- Land: FARP West\n- Transportation: Troops provide their own transportation to FARP West\n- Class I: 4 Boxes of MRES\n- Equipment: 3x Raven, Notebook and Pen\n- Uniform: OCPs, ACH, Eye Pro, Dragoon Standard (Stryker Transportation)",
